- The graffitis are CustomModelData of Carrot on a Stick, so with custom Model and customs texture; they are displayed on an invisible Item Frame.
- The selection of the graffitis is made by a book, you can select a graffiti by clicking on a button displayed on the page of the book. Each page represent a different graffiti.
